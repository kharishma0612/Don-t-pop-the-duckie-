Don't pop the Duckie

"Don't Pop the Duckie" is an interactive, category-based word guessing game inspired by the classic game of Hangman. Players are tasked with guessing a word from a specific category (such as Gen AI, Web Development, Machine Learning, etc.) before a series of unfortunate events cause the Duckie in the game to face its demise.
The game’s progression involves a narrative where a cute duckie is initially seen enjoying its time in a pool, working with a laptop and wearing headphones. However, as the player makes incorrect guesses, the duckie faces challenges that degrade its surroundings and its own equipment, eventually leading to its demise.

Phase 1: The duckie is happily swimming with a laptop and headphones on. The pool is full of water, and the duckie is content.
Phase 2: As incorrect guesses mount, the pool begins to drain slowly, and the headphones fall off the duckie.
Phase 3: The laptop screen starts to crack, symbolizing further damage.
Phase 4: The pool empties completely, and additional small items break around the duckie, such as the laptop losing functionality.
Final Phase: The duckie reaches its breaking point, and the environment is fully destroyed, leading to the duckie's "death" (symbolized by a dramatic animation of the duckie’s demise).

Instead of the typical starfish or other elements popping in the middle of game, "Don't Pop the Duckie" uses cats and trains to provide visual interest and thematic fun.
